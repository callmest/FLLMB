## What is New?
- The tutorial aims to reproduce llms in one notebook. And not only just the model architecture, but also training and inference process.
- It means that you will see three parts in the notebook: 
    - Model Architectures: modules and ensembles
    - Model Debug: debug the message passing through each layer and each method
    - Training and inference: some models may not update inference process, but it would be completed very soon. 
- Feel free to give suggestions and feedbacks!
